# Example of Golang CRUD using MySQL from scratch

# Zontroy Code Generator
Zontroy Code Generator is used to add code generation templates to the project. By minimizing the parts prone to code repetition with Zontroy code generator, I reduced the complexity of the project and made it more user-friendly. I generated code using zsif, zref and ziref file types. When I wanted to produce more than one repeated folder, I used the ziref file type by taking entities from the mssql database. I used zsif to prevent code repetition in the same file, and zref to create different files suitable for code repetition. For more information you can visit https://zontroy.com/. This repository show how to do database CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations using Zontroy Code Generator, Golang and MySQL.

## Install app

1. Clone the app
```
git clone https://github.com/hashi7412/crud-with-mysql.git <project_name>
```

2. Create database
```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `employee`;
CREATE TABLE `employee` (
  `id` int(6) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(30) NOT NULL,
  `city` varchar(30) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
```

3. Install Golang packages
```
cd <project_name>
go get -u github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

4. Run the program
```
go run .
```

5. Load the following URL

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Guide the repository

### [main.go](https://github.com/hashi7412/crud-with-mysql/blob/main/main.go)

- dbConn()

This function connect to database and return a handler

Here is sql connection example:
```
sql.Open(<db_driver>, "<db_driver>:<db_pass>@<db_name>")
```

- Index()

This function executes `forms/Index.tmpl` to show table of employee data

- Show()

`Show` function executes `forms/Show.tmpl` to show details of an employee

- New()

This function executes `forms/New.tmpl` to show the interface to insert an employee detail

- Edit()

This function executes `forms/Edit.tmpl` to show the inerface to edit an employee detail

- Insert()

This function handles to insert data from `Edit` page

- Update()

This function handles to update data from `Edit` page

- Delete()

This function handles to delete data

- main()

The main function that is executed first implementes a handler function for multiple URL paths that provide functionalities.
